# Roam CSS additionals

This repository is my personal CSS additionals for Roam Research.

It is used on top of the [Better Roam Research](https://github.com/linuz90/better-roam-research) theme.
Feel free to use it if you like.

## How to use

1. Inside Roam Research, create a page named exactly roam/css
2. Create a [[Better Roam Research]] bullet point.
3. Create a child code block inside it (you can write three backticks to create it: ```) and change it to css
4. Paste this in the code block @import url("https://linuz90.github.io/better-roam-research/main.css");
5. Create a [[Personal Styles]] bullet point.
6. Create a child code block inside it (you can write three backticks to create it: ```) and change it to css
7. Paste this in the code block @import url("https://hphoeksma.github.io/roam-css/main.css");

**Note** I haven't tried differently, but I use my styles above the Better Roam Research theme in the roam/css page.
